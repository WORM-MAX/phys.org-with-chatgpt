All the electrons that make up those tracks drift along, potentially overlapping and interfering with one another.\n", "There's also a complex system of lasers inside the TPC, which will produce known electron tracks scientists use to compare with those generated by particles emitted from collisions.\n", "\"It's going to be like a discothèque inside with lasers going every which way,\" Morrison said. \"We need to make sure we understand how the lasers work, how the TPC works, and all the other components when there aren't very many collisions per second before we ramp up to full luminosity.\"\n", "Meanwhile, even with low collision rates at the beginning of the run, STAR will be making use of the high collision energy.\n", "\"The last 200 GeV gold-gold run at RHIC was in 2016,\" said STAR co-spokesperson Lijuan Ruan, a physicist at Brookhaven. Since then, she explained, one detector component that was great for ", " needed at the time but that reduced the resolution of other measurements has been removed—thus promising increased resolution for this run. In addition, a slew of STAR component upgrades has increased the detector's ability to track particles closest to the collision point and also at the widest angles ever in the \"forward\" direction at one end of the detector.\n", "\"Run 23 is the first time all those detector upgrades will see particles emerging from interactions at RHIC's top collision energy,\" Ruan said.\n", "During this run and the planned run for 2025, which will also collide gold ions at 200 GeV, the STAR team will use those components and the rest of STAR's capabilities to collect high-statistics data on particles with very low energy or transverse momentum. Extending measurements of these so-called \"soft observables\" into the forward region, for example, can help reveal global properties of the QGP. Examples include how particles ", " through the plasma, the temperature dependence of variables such as ", ", and the degree to which variations in the interactions among quarks and gluons influence the ", " of particles streaming out.\n", "\"Previously, we were looking at one observable or another at a time and comparing those measurements with predictions from models to get conclusions,\" Ruan said. \"But now, with the new detector capabilities and high statistics, we are entering a precision era using multiple observables—a multi-messenger approach—to look at them globally. That will inform our understanding of the evolution of heavy ion collisions and the properties of the QGP.\"\n", "To get those high statistics, STAR will also make use of a recent upgrade that more than doubles the readout speed of its TPC. Previously able to record a maximum of 2000 events per second, the STAR TPC can now capture up to 5000 collisions in less than the blink of an eye.\n", "With the run starting at relatively low luminosity, STAR physicists may not be able to push their detector to that max level until later this summer. But they understand the need to provide sPHENIX with the conditions needed to come up to speed.\n", "\"Commissioning their detector is the most important thing for this run. We will collect data, but sPHENIX is going to be driving the run,\" said Yale University physicist Helen Caines, who recently concluded her six-year term as a STAR co-spokesperson.\n", "When the collision rates ramp up, STAR will be ready.\n", "\"We have the best particle acceptance, highest-rate detector that we've had at STAR at this point, so we're going to collect data with the best and most comprehensive suite of detectors we've had to date,\" Caines said. \"This will be a data set that we can analyze for a long time into the future.\"\n", "The sPHENIX collaboration is also eager to get to full luminosity to begin addressing the physics questions it was designed to answer.\n", "\"Our plan is for several weeks of data taking for physics, which would happen after commissioning the detector,\" sPHENIX collaboration co-spokesperson Morrison said. \"There's a ton of physics that sPHENIX can do with that data.\"\n", "The new detector's mission will focus on hard probes—energetic particle jets and particles made from heavy quarks, which require a lot of energy to generate.\n", "\"We'll get RHIC's first look at jets that come from the fragmentation of the very heavy bottom quark with fantastic statistical precision. These measurements can explore what happens to pairs of jets in a collision, for example those produced at different orientations relative to the rest of the particles coming out,\" Morrison said. \"That can help tell us how the truly microscopic interactions of quarks and gluons produce QGP properties like its ", ".\"\n", "\"We'll start seeing what happens to the three different members of the upsilon family of mesons,\" each made of a bottom quark bound to an antibottom quark but with different binding energies, he noted. Those measurements will give the scientists information about the length scale of the strong-force interactions among quarks and gluons, and potentially the temperature of the QGP.\n", "The point of sPHENIX, MIT's Roland said, \"is to get a complete picture of the collisions in terms of these hard probes and in terms of their correlations with the soft particles that represent the bulk of the QGP once it turns back into hadrons [composite particles made of quarks and/or antiquarks].\"\n", "Some of those measurements will rely on additional gold-gold collision data collected in the 2025 run, and proton-proton collisions in 2024, which will provide essential comparison data.\n", "\"The full physics program requires as much data as can possibly be collected in RHIC's remaining runs to give us the statistical reach to complete the sPHENIX program,\" Roland said.\n", "RHIC's experiments rely on accelerator physicists' ability to deliver ", " at specified energies and rates within each detector. Under the guidance of Run 23 Coordinator Travis Shrey, the Collider-Accelerator Department (C-AD) staff at this DOE Office of Science user facility will demonstrate their strengths and the machine's versatility.\n", "As noted, the run will start with beams of gold ions (the nuclei of gold atoms stripped of their electrons) entering RHIC's two counter-circulating rings at low intensity—meaning fewer bunches of particles and fewer particles per bunch—to keep the number of collisions low. But each beam will be accelerated to collide at full energy inside the sPHENIX and STAR detectors located at interaction regions where the two rings cross.\n", "RHIC has traditionally operated with the two beams traveling in opposite directions passing straight through one another inside the detectors. This allows collisions to occur between particles in the opposing beams across the entire length of each pair of colliding bunches. But for this run, the particles will travel a different path to cross one another at an angle.\n", "\"This crossing angle creates a narrower collision zone, which will improve the performance particularly of the sPHENIX detector,\" said Wolfram Fischer, chair of C-AD.\n", "During sPHENIX commissioning, accelerator physicists will use a range of tools to monitor the size and positions of the beams—and techniques to control those beam properties—to maintain a slow but constant collision rate at STAR.\n", "Monitoring and optimizing beams will continue as the collision rate ramps up, taking advantage of a newly recommissioned \"", "\" system and a refurbished superconducting radiofrequency (RF) cavity.\n", "\"Sensors in the stochastic cooling system measure small random fluctuations in the positions of the particles within each bunch of particles and send signals to 'kicker' cavities that nudge the particles back together. These nudges result in more dense bunches,\" explained Michiko Minty, head of the Accelerator Division of C-AD. \"Similarly, the 56-megahertz RF cavity, together with the other RF cavities, will prevent bunches from lengthening due to intrabeam scattering.\"\n", "All this squeezing and shortening of ion bunches increases the chance that the ions will collide. It also helps maintain the shorter beam-crossover region inside the sPHENIX detector.\n", "\"Higher beam intensities will also be available thanks to a recent upgrade in the Electron-Beam Ion Source (EBIS),\" Minty said. EBIS is the machine that generates RHIC's heavy ion beams and injects them into the accelerator chain that feeds the beams into the collider. \"This year we'll be operating with up to 40 percent more gold beam than in any previous run,\" she said.\n", "In addition to delivering gold to the experiments, the C-AD staff will be implementing new systems for protecting the detectors when RHIC's beams are dumped periodically. They'll also be conducting tests of additional beam-cooling systems and acceleration schemes that will play a role in post-RHIC C-AD operations at Brookhaven, when many of RHIC's accelerator components are transformed into an ", " (EIC).\n", "\"We plan to make use of every second of this run to help sPHENIX and STAR accomplish their goals and to explore all the ways we can get the most out of the world's most versatile particle accelerator and collider complex—both now and in the future,\" Fischer said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"], "pdf": ["https://phys.org/news/2023-05-rhic-ready-gold-ions.pdf"]},

While emitters based on these materials have shown promising device performance, integrating their fabrication processes into standard complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) platforms remains challenging.\n", "While silicon (Si) has shown potential as a candidate material for nanoscale and individually controllable emitters, Si emitters suffer from low quantum efficiency because of the indirect bandgap, and this fundamental disadvantage combined with the limitations set by the available materials and fabrication tools has hindered the realization of a small native Si emitter in CMOS.\n", "In a recently published ", " paper titled \"A sub-wavelength Si LED integrated in a CMOS platform,\" SMART researchers described their development of the smallest reported Si emitter with a ", " comparable to that of state-of-the-art Si emitters with much larger emission areas. In a related breakthrough, SMART researchers also unveiled their construction of a novel, untrained deep neural network architecture capable of reconstructing images from a holographic microscope in a paper titled \"Simultaneous spectral recovery and CMOS micro-LED holography with an untrained deep neural network\" recently published in the journal ", ".\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    ", "The novel LED developed by SMART researchers is a CMOS-integrated sub-wavelength scale LED at room temperature exhibiting high spatial intensity (102 ± 48 mW/cm", ") and possessing the smallest emission area (0.09 ± 0.04 μm", ") among all known Si emitters in scientific literature. In order to demonstrate a potential practical application, the researchers then integrated this LED into an in-line, centimeter-scale, all-silicon holographic microscope requiring no lens or pinhole, integral to a field known as lensless holography.\n", "A commonly faced obstacle in lensless holography is computational reconstruction of the imaged object. Traditional reconstruction methods require detailed knowledge of the experimental setup for accurate reconstruction and are sensitive to difficult-to-control variables such as optical aberrations, the presence of noise, and the twin image problem.\n", "The research team also developed a deep neural network architecture to improve the quality of image reconstruction. This novel, untrained deep neural network incorporates total variation regularization for increased contrast and takes into account the wide spectral bandwidth of the source.\n", "Unlike traditional methods of computational reconstruction that require training data, this neural network eliminates the need for training by embedding a physics model within the algorithm. In addition to holographic image reconstruction, the neutral network also offers blind source spectrum recovery from a single diffracted intensity pattern, which marks a groundbreaking departure from all previous supervised learning techniques.\n", "The untrained neural network demonstrated in this study allows researchers to use novel light sources without prior knowledge of the source spectrum or beam profile, such as the novel and smallest known Si LED described above, fabricated via a fully commercial, unmodified bulk CMOS microelectronics.\n", "The researchers envision that this synergetic combination of CMOS micro-LEDs and the neural network can be used in other computational imaging applications, such as a compact microscope for live-cell tracking or spectroscopic imaging of biological tissues such as living plants. This work also demonstrates the feasibility of next-generation on-chip imaging systems. Already, in-line holography microscopes have been employed for a variety of applications, including particle tracking, environmental monitoring, biological sample imaging, and metrology. Further applications include arraying these LEDs in CMOS to generate programmable coherent illumination for more complex systems in the future.\n", "Iksung Kang, lead author of the ", " paper and research assistant at MIT at the time of this research, said, \"Our breakthrough represents a proof of concept that could be hugely impactful for numerous applications requiring the use of micro-LEDs. For instance, this LED could be combined into an array for higher levels of illumination needed for larger-scale applications. In addition, due to the low cost and scalability of microelectronics CMOS processes, this can be done without increasing the system's complexity, cost, or form factor. This enables us to convert, with relative ease, a mobile phone camera into a holographic microscope of this type. Furthermore, control electronics and even the imager could be integrated into the same chip by exploiting the available electronics in the process, thus creating an all-in-one micro-LED that could be transformative for the field.\"\n", "\"On top of its immense potential in lensless holography, our new LED has a wide range of other possible applications. Because its wavelength is within the minimum absorption window of biological tissues, together with its high intensity and nanoscale emission area, our LED could be ideal for bio-imaging and bio-sensing applications, including near-field microscopy and implantable CMOS devices,\" added Rajeev Ram, principal investigator at SMART CAMP and DiSTAP, Professor of Electrical Engineering at MIT and co-author of both papers. \"Also, it is possible to integrate this LED with on-chip photodetectors, and it could then find further applications in on-chip communication, NIR proximity sensing, and on-wafer testing of photonics.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"], "pdf": ["https://phys.org/news/2023-05-technology-enables-conversion-mobile-cameras.pdf"]},

This technology could also allow monitoring without the presence of humans, which would mean less pollution and a less invasive presence in the marine environment.\"\n", "Lidar systems create images by measuring how long it takes laser light to be reflected from objects in the scene and travel back to the system's receiver, known as the \"time of flight.\" In the new work, the researchers sought to develop a way to acquire 3D images of targets that are obscured by turbid water and thus not visible to conventional lidar imaging systems.\n", "They designed a lidar system that uses a green pulsed laser source to illuminate the scene of interest. The reflected pulsed illumination is detected by an array of single-photon detectors, which allows ultrafast low light detection and greatly reduces measurement time in photon-starved environments such as highly attenuating water.\n", "\"By taking time-of-flight measurements with picosecond timing resolution, we can routinely resolve millimeter details of the targets in the scene,\" said Maccarone. \"Our approach also allows us to distinguish the photons reflected by the target from those reflected by particles in the water, making it particularly suitable to performing 3D imaging in highly turbid waters where optical scattering can ruin image contrast and resolution.\"\n", "The fact that this approach requires thousands of single-photon detectors, all producing many hundreds of events per second, makes it extremely challenging to retrieve and process the data necessary to reconstruct the 3D image in a short time, especially for real-time applications. To solve this problem, the researchers developed algorithms specifically for imaging in highly scattering conditions and applied them in conjunction with widely available graphics processing unit (GPU) hardware.\n", "The new technique builds on some important technological advances. \"Heriot-Watt University has a long track record in single‑photon detection techniques and image processing of single-photon data, which allowed us to demonstrate advanced single‑photon imaging in extremely challenging conditions,\" said Maccarone.\n", "\"The University of Edinburgh has achieved fundamental advances in the design and fabrication of single-photon avalanche diode detector arrays, which allowed us to build compact and robust imaging systems based on quantum detection technologies.\"\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t    ", "After optimizing the optical setup on a laboratory optical bench, the researchers connected the lidar system to a GPU to achieve real-time processing of the data while also implementing a number of image processing approaches for three-dimensional imaging.
